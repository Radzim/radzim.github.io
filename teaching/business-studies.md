## Blurb

You're probably seeing this because I will be your supervisor for Business Studies this year. Welcome!

This course can be relatively easy for some, with a good marks-to-time ratio, but beware trying to get marks without revising, as the lecturer really likes to ask about concepts and ideas you actually need to memorise, and you can get some really low scores if you're overconfident. It's very much worth it to get your hands on Jack Lang's book, he used to do the course together with Stewart, and it covers a lot of the material - I'll share a pdf with you after the second supervision to help you with revision. If you have trouble understanding more concrete frameworks like cashflows or valuations, look to investopedia or youtube for help.

I'm happy to supervise Online, in the Computer Lab, or in Churchill. For online supervisions I will be calling you on Teams, I'll follow this up with you closer to. Please let me know if you have any questions or requests re- course or scheduling. Also, let me know what kind of supervisions you prefer so I can put out more slots like that.

This course only has two supervisions, so it's one of the more flexible ones to schedule - that being said it's going to be hard to fit two supervisions in before the end of term and undergrad interviews, so it's quite likely that we will have one or two of them outside of term. If this is something you want to avoid, please let me know!

Please book supervisions through KuDoS, and make sure you're in contact with your supervision partners. If there are any issues, or you are otherwise not on track to complete your work by the time you booked, let me know - I much prefer to postpone the supervision but get complete work.
